## Motivations and Goals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a graduate from Ball State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have an astute determination for utilizing code to create something new; the entire process provides me with a great sense of accomplishment. I am looking to enhance a company's goals while further building on my academic and practical knowledge, refining my computer programming skills,  and augmenting the communication proficiency required to strengthen interdisciplinary professional relationships. On a personal level, I am deeply interested in becoming an artisan of computer programming by applying abilities I have already obtained, as well as cutting-edge techniques I have yet to learn. I am currently most comfortable with front end development having a strong understanding of .net and React.js. As a graduate of Ball State University’s undergraduate Computer Science program, I possess the problem-solving, organizational, critical thinking, and fundamental interpersonal skills in order to strive for excellence within the company.
